# ARKANOID-BASED GAME MADE IN C++
  
## About the Project
This Arkanoid-Based Game was developed as part of the Data Structures course at the Technological Institute of Costa Rica (TEC). The project focuses on implementing advanced data structures, such as AVL Trees, Linked Lists, and Event Queues, within the context of a dynamic and interactive game.  
The game features both single-player and multiplayer modes, along with a statistics showcase that includes text-to-speech (TTS) functionality to pronounce the player's name.  
The game was a collaborative effort between Isaac Villalobos and Kevin Vega, showcasing our skills in both game development and the application of data structures in real-world scenarios.  
Any questions or inquiries about the inner workings of the project can be directed to my personal email: IsaacVillalobosB@gmail.com.  
  
## Features
Dynamic Gameplay: A modern take on the classic Arkanoid game.  
Data Structure Integration: AVL Trees for efficient data retrieval, Linked Lists for managing game objects and enemies, Event Queues for handling user input and game events.  
Interactive Elements: Sprites for dynamic and visually appealing graphics (Using Allegro), Music and Sound Effects for an immersive experience, Text-to-Speech (TTS): Announces the player's name during the statistics showcase.
Statistics Showcase: View player stats after each match, including scores and performance metrics.  

## Technologies Used
Programming Language: C++  
Graphics: Sprites (using a Allegro)  
Sound and TTS: Integrated music, sound effects, and text-to-speech features  
Data Structures: AVL Trees, Linked Lists, and Event Queues    
Development Environment: Visual Studio 2022  
Version Control: GitHub  

## Installation and Usage
1) Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/IsaacVil/Arkanoid-Game.git  
2) Open the project in your preferred C++ IDE or compiler (Compatible with the Allegro library).  
3) Build and run the project to launch the clinic simulation system.  
4) XML files will be automatically generated and updated during runtime to store all clinic data.  

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, we:  
Mastered the implementation of advanced data structures for practical applications.  
Enhanced our skills in C++ programming and system design.  
Developed an interactive game with a focus on user experience, including AI and TTS.  
Improved teamwork and collaboration through Git version control.  

## Acknowledgments
We would like to thank our professor and classmates at TEC for their guidance and support throughout the development of this project.
